Hi,

This propject converts excelsheet to latex file which generates 3-D graph with power as one more dimension.

Example:
python3 <name of excel file> <name of the sheet>
python3 excel_to_latex.py qTesla_sign_and_sign_open.xlsx ASIC_Sign_200Mhz
Output file=qTesla_sign_and_sign_open.xlsx_ASIC_Sign_200Mhz
